# Reading List

So, here I'm just going to drop links to Public Domain/Creative Commons works. If I end up with enough things, I'll just go ahead and seperate into different sections, depending on what you all are looking for. 

### A Heads Up

I am not scouring all of these. So, there's almost guarenteed to be some problematic stuff. Right now, I'm just adding if it looks like there's good tech. If you want any particular book removed, please let me know and I'll remove it from the lists :3
