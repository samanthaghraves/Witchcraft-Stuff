#Tarot Decks

So, these are some of the suggestions that I've gotten about decks, and I
want to keep them in one place. Feel free to suggest any you like on 
occult.camp, and the list will be updated accordingly.

If there's anything in particular you like to divine with the deck, 
or you want to write a little bio for a particular deck, please let me know!
